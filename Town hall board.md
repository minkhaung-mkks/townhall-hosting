## 3\. Problem Statement & Motivation

**What problem does this system solve?**  
User that want user-written articles often rely on social media or forums, which lack structured publishing, version control, and approval before content goes public. This system would let users publish written works while ensuring quality and safety through editor approval and site moderation. 

The site could even serve as an online novel site for aspiring writers.

**Who is the target user?**  
Primary: readers who browse and comment on published works.  
Secondary: creators who want to submit works for publishing.  
Staff: editors who review/approve submissions, and admins who moderate content and users.

**Why does this problem matter?**  
Without approval and moderation, platforms can quickly fill with low-quality or harmful content. A simple workflow (submit → review → publish) supports community publishing while keeping trust and content quality.
